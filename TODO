Script:
    write a script to automate the entire process.
    1. ensure Docker exists on the machine.(make sure the memory is high on docker machine.)
    2. run docker-compose
    3. push nifi template to nifi.
    4. run a script to insert data to Mysql.

Docker:
    create named volumes on docker-compose for mysql, cassandra.
    add build commands as we need to build images if they do not exist.

NIFI:
    create nifi templates folder underneath the repository.
    use nifi api deploy to push remotes instead of manually importing templates through nifi UI (https://github.com/aperepel/nifi-api-deploy)
    need to create an entrypoint file to download sql connector for nifi.

Demo-service:
    create an entrypoint file to start the service.


HDP:
    inorder to write data to Hive, add HDP to docker project.
    edit nifi flow to write data over to hive(parquet format) in parallel to cassandra.
